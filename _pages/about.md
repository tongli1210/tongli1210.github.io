I am currently an Assistant Professor in the [School of Biomedical Engineering](https://med.szu.edu.cn/en/academics/departments/content_546) at [Shenzhen University](https://en.szu.edu.cn/). My research interests focus on medical image processing, along with machine learning and deep learning for biomedical and healthcare applications - encompassing multi-modal biomedical data fusion, multi-modal large models, and their utility in computer-aided diagnosis and precision medicine.
